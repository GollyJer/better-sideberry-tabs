## zen-sideberry-tabs

I love Zen Browser but can't give up the way Sidebery handles...
 - panels
 - tab groups
 - tab containers
and most of all
 - tree style tabs

This is an attempt at making Sideberry fit into the default style of Zen Browser.
The content of `StylesEditor.css` can be pasted directly into the Styles Editor setting in Sidebery. 
Works with Zen, Floorp, and all Firefox based browsers that support the Sidebery add-on.

The primary adjustments are...
 - Rounded corners for that smooth look
 - Larger text & tab height for better readability ðŸ“š
 - Animated click events for a touch of flair âœ¨

All options are easily adjustable by playing with the CSS. ðŸŽ¨

TODO  
1) Don't animate the tree lines when clicking a nested tab. ðŸš«ðŸŒ³
